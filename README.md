## Type classes in Dotty example

This is a code example for [this post](https://guillaumebogard.dev/posts/typeclasses/) covering Type classes in Scala
and Dotty.

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project, you can compile code with `sbt compile` and run it
with `sbt run`, `sbt console` will start a Dotty REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
